Boolean Operators: not
The final boolean operator we will cover is not. This operator is straightforward: when applied to any boolean expression it reverses the boolean 
value. So if we have a True statement and apply a not operator we get a False statement.

Instructions
1. Set the variables statement_one and statement_two equal to the results of the following boolean expressions:
Statement one:
not (4 + 5 <= 9)

Statement two:
not (8 * 2) != 20 - 4

2. The registrar’s office at Calvin Coolidge’s Cool College has been so impressed with your work so far that they have another task for you.
They want you to return to a previous if statement and add in several checks using and and not statements:

If a student’s credits is not greater or equal to 120, it should print:
"You do not have enough credits to graduate."

If their gpa is not greater or equal to 2.0, it should print:
"Your GPA is not high enough to graduate."

If their credits is not greater than or equal to 120 and their gpa is not greater than or equal to 2.0, it should print:
"You do not meet either requirement to graduate!"
